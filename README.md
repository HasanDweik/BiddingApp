# BiddingApp
This is a bidding system application developed using React.js and Laravel. I worked on this project on both sides front and back. And two mates helped me in the backend to finish it.
Some parts of the system design and the interface are taken from EA's FUT Web App.
The Backend-side is developed using three teers architecture combined with MVC that is given by the Laravel Framework.
The Fronend-side is developed using a personal architecture as a signiture.
Feel free to cantact mee for details.
